Air Pollution in the Tristate Area: Trends & Health Effects
We examined the trends in outdoor air quality, based on established air quality indicators, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also examined potential trends in the temporal associations between air pollutants and specific health effects in humans.

Project Overview
We examined the trends in outdoor air quality, based on established air quality indicators, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also examined potential trends in the temporal associations between air pollutants and specific health effects in humans. 
Key Questions:
What are the trends for Air Quality Indicators (AQIs) for the tristate area over the last 40 years?
What are the trends in the air quality-related health outcomes in the tristate area over the last 10 years?
Are specific air pollutant gases more closely associated with negative health outcomes than others in the tristate area?
Backgroud
Clean Air Act was passed in 1963, with amendments in 1970 and 1990. 
Air pollution is associated with several health effects, particularly respiratory illness.
Air quality measurements for the tristate area (NY, NJ, CT) have not consistently met the U.S. EPA  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).a
Methods
EPA AQI Data
EPA Individual air pollutant data (gases)
Limitations:  Used data available
Note: all years and/or locations not available for all datasets
Utilized zip_download function to download the large datasets for data more than a decade
Utilized API and Seaborn to create heat maps for ozone levels in tristate by county
Overall
Air quality in the tristate area has improved since 1980 and over our assessment period (2006 – 2016)
Forty-year data shows consistent increases in the number of Acceptable AQ days and a corresponding decrease in Poor AQ days.
Individual Air Pollutants (average concentration)
2006 to 2009 – consistent decrease
2010 to 2013 – some increases noted
2013 to 2016 – mostly decreasing trend for CO, SO2; some increases noted for NO2, O3
Hospitalizations (Asthma & COPD) & ED visits (Asthma)
Asthma: Increases noted beginning in 2008 with ED visits remaining steady afterwards and a decreasing trend in asthma-related admissions
COPD hospitalizations: Increase noted 2008 – 2011; subsequent decrease until 2015.
Start of increasing trend noted in 2016, which coincides with increase in ozone concentrations.
